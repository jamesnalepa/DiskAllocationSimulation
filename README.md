# DiskAllocationSimulation

This is simulation of both contiguous and indexed disk allocation with visible tracking of file sizes and locations measured in blocks as well as head
moves per edit.

The disk.dat file contains the instructions that get read into the program, though I believe a user input system would be cleaner if possible.
